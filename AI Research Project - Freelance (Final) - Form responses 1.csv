Challenges: AI systems often require large amounts of data, which can include sensitive or personal information, raising concerns about data breaches and misuse.
Overcome: Implement robust encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. Adhere to data privacy regulations  and establish clear data governance policies.

Integration with Existing Systems
Challenges: Existing systems may not be designed to support AI technologies, leading to compatibility issues and requiring significant modifications.
Overcome: Use middleware and APIs to facilitate integration. Plan phased implementation with pilot projects to identify and address integration challenges early.

High Implementation Cost
Challenges: AI adoption requires significant investment in technology, infrastructure, and skilled personnel, which can be prohibitively expensive.
Overcome: Start with scalable cloud-based solutions to reduce initial costs.
